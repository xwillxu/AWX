Welcome to AWX, which by the way stands for Austin, William, Xwill. These three people are the founders of AWX. In truth there were four founders of AWX because, it was used to be call AWLX. The L standing for Lucas, also known as Lucas the menace. Just so you know AWX was founded in late November. There purpose: to find out why did the school property seperate into different divisions. During the months of November, December everybody at AWX (sorry(sarcastic) AWLX). After figuring out what was going on and the problem was solved everybody we gained in those months left. Tristan, Daniel, Lucas, Cyrus, Ricky, Adam... (Because I can't remember anybody else) left. Six months later AWX grew with two more people. Now a whole year after the real purpose AWX grew to ten people. On Jan 10, 2023 existence was revealed to the world. Well lets just say the cubing part of the organization. LOL! Anyways, later that month Daniel and Will J wanted to join. Will J could not join because if you already have 5+ bans before you enter the organization you can't join. Will J already had 36 bans because of a bunch of reasons.
